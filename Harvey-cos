I was born in Caraga Region Hospital, Surigao City, and raised in Brgy. Punta Bilar, Surigao City, Surigao del Norte. I graduated elementary at Punta Bilar from Kindergarten to Grade 6. When I turned 12, my family moved to Batangas City, where my cousins and aunt lived. I continued my education in Batangas, attending school in Brgy. Bulihan, Malvar, Batangas, from Grade 7 to Grade 11. During my time there, I met a lot of new people and made great memories.

In Grade 12, I returned to Surigao City, where I reconnected with old friends and met new ones. This was also when I met my amazing girlfriend. Along with enjoying time with my friends, I continued to pursue hobbies like going to the gym, watching anime, and exploring new places.
